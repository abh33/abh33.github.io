Rescue operations pose a grave danger to victim as well as to those  assigned the job of saving the lives of victims. Rescuing people in case of fire and explosion in any cityscape comprising numerous buildings  (these may be including residential, commercial, industrial,  petroleum/chemical distribution, maritime, construction, and  agricultural buildings etc) is a risky and crucial operation.

Robots can be used in such applications to save lives of people and also provide crucial information that can further be used by experts  for decision making. The purpose of Rapid Rescuer is to rescue victims  from dangerous or unpleasant situations to safer locations.

Motivated by this idea, in the current edition of **e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC 2020-21)** we have designed a theme, **“Nirikshak Bot”**.

The arena for the theme is an abstraction of a city in the form of a maze. An image of a maze will be given to teams and using Image  Processing, teams have to find the shortest path from start node to  final node. This information will be communicated to the Bot. The goal  is to traverse the shortest path and evacuate people from different  locations to a safe place whilst avoiding unknown obstacles.

Challenges in this theme include Image Processing, Algorithm  building, Wireless Communication, Building a Bot, Embedded C  programming.

The critical factor is time and the challenge is to complete the  given tasks in the shortest time possible whilst incurring the least penalties. The teams that perform the task best in accordance with the  rules will be declared the **WINNER** of the competition.

All the best !!
