Market size evaluation of Agriculture and allied industries was a whopping US$276.67 Billion dollars in fiscal year 2020 and guess what!? - these figures are only for the Indian context. We are encountering a new revolution in modern agriculture that is being driven by constant technological integrations and improvements. These range from drones to the implementation of smart sensors (IoT) and from research involving rural as well as urban farmers to using robots for weeding and seeding. 



The introduction of technology in agriculture can directly lead to more crop yield and using robots can achieve all this and more with high precision and accuracy. Their use significantly improves the speed of the entire process thereby increasing the profitability. Through **e-Yantra Robotics Competition (eYRC 2021-22)** we are trying to emulate the same by introducing the theme **Berryminator**.



The theme is set in an indoor environment where concepts of urban farming are being explored. The whole arena is abstracted as a simulation environment where berries are grown in vertically stacked trays within various rooms. The robot in the simulator navigates in the rooms and galleries of the complex in which the environment is controlled to provide optimal berriesâ€™ growth. The robot then identifies the berries and plucks them depending on various factors like size, ripeness and requirement.



Challenges in this theme include **Robotic Simulation**, **Image Processing, 3D Designing, Algorithm Building, Robot Navigation and localization, Python programming and Lua programming**.



The critical factor is time and the challenge is to complete the given tasks in the shortest possible time whilst incurring the least penalties. The teams that perform the task best in accordance with the rules will be declared the **WINNER** of the competition.



All the best !!
