Quality Assurance is an integral part of Industry 4.0. Since mass manufacturing has been a key focus of most of the industries to meet the demands of the growing population, Quality Assurance benefits both the company and the customer. 

Quality Assurance allows the industries to reduce defects and mistakes in their product thereby improving their brand image in the minds of the customers. Some of the standards like [ISO 9000](https://www.iso.org/iso-9001-quality-management.html) family allow the industries to meet this criteria. These also make sure that the industry develops reliable and safe products for the customer.

Robots can achieve this with high precision and accuracy. They also drastically improve the speed of the entire manufacturing chain thereby increasing the profitability per product. The purpose of निरीक्षक Bot (Inspector Bot) is to determine the quality of the Ball Balancing Platform designed and manufactured in an industry.

The theme is set in an industry manufacturing ball balancing platforms. A maze is attached on top of it. A conveyor belt keeps on dropping balls at regular intervals on the ball balancing table. The goal is to make the balls traverse through maze on defined paths within the stipulated amount of time in order to determine the quality of the table manufactured.

Challenges in this theme include Image Processing, Control Systems, 3D Designing, Algorithm Building, Robotic Simulation, Python programming and Lua programming.

The critical factor is time and the challenge is to complete the given tasks in the shortest time possible whilst incurring the least penalties. The teams that perform the task best in accordance with the rules will be declared the WINNER of the competition.

All the best !!
