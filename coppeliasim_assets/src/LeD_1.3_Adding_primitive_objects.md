# 			Adding Primitive Objects

- This section explains the various shapes available in the CoppeliaSim and how to add them on scene.
- The main features in the dialog box of the shapes will be explained.

## Available Shapes

CoppeliaSim supports **five** **primitive shapes**

1. **Plane**
2. **Disc**
3. **Cuboid**
4. **Sphere**
5. **Cylinder**

We can also import other shapes from an external file. You can refer this link to read more about importing and exporting shapes in CoppeliaSim.

## 	Adding Shapes

You can add the **available primitive shapes** to the scene using the following steps.

```
Menu bar --> Add --> Primitive shape --> select the desired shape
```

You can see the steps for adding a **cuboid** in the below gif.

## Dialog Box Features

**Parameters of the shapes** can be adjusted in the **dialog box** that appears while adding the shape.

This shows the **dialog box** of a cuboid. Here we can change the **dimensions of the shape** in the x, y and z size columns. These are the size along the **world reference frame's x- / y- / z-axis**. Similarly for discs and cylinders radius can be adjusted.

## Practice 

Add various shapes into the scene and try to **create** **small models**. Make the models more aesthetic by adding colours to them using scene object properties.  A sample image is given for your reference.
